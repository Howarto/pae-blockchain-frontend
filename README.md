UPC-FIB-PAE Project 2018-2019 Q1

# Why this project?
PAE is a subject from FIB(Facultat d'inform√†tica de Barcelona) that wants to teach to students abilities to create and sell ideas.

For this year, we have a challenge related with Blockchain. We need to use this technology to solve an actual problem.

The chosen product was a LinkedIn with the possibility to validate students or workers aptitudes, works and studies. The main reason to do it is that has been detected workers during last year without the career that they pretend to have.

Also, the system allows to maintain automated processes like: as a university, validate student's subjects and validate the whole career if all the subjects were passed.

# Commands to run the project
